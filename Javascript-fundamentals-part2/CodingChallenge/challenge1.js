/*
    Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins
    and the Koalas! There is a new gymnastics discipline,
    which works differently.
    Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of
    the scores is calculated (so one average score per
    team).
    A team ONLY wins if it has at least DOUBLE the 
    average score of the other team. Otherwise, no team
    wins!

    1. Create an arrow function 'calcAverage' to
    calculate the average of 3 scores
    2. Use the function to calculate the average for both
    teams
    3. Create a function 'checkWinner' that takes the 
    average score of each team as parameters
    ('avgDolphins' and 'avgKoalas', and then logs the
    winner to the console, together with the victory
    points, according to the rule above. Example: "Koalas
    win (30 vs 13)".
    4. Use the 'checkWinner' function to determine the 
    winner for both DATA 1 and DATA 2.
    5. Ignore draws this time.

    TEST DATA 1: Dolphins score 44, 23 and 71. Koalas score 65, 54 and 49.
    TEST DATA 2: Dolphins score 85, 54 and 41. Koalas score 23, 34 and 27.

    HINT: To calculate average of 3 values, add them all 
    together and divide by 3
    HINT: To check if number A is at least double number 
    B, check for A >= 2* B. Apply this to the team's
    average scores

    GOOD LUCK
